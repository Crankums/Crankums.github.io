<p>I'm transitioning from a career in dance and bike mechanics to software engineering. I've always been fond of building things and setting them in motion; coding is really just an extension of that in my experience. I recently completed Flatiron School's Software Engineering bootcamp and I look forward to the opportunities my new skillset will offer me.</p>
